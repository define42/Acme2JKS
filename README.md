# ACME2JKS Keystore/Truststore Exporter

ACME2JKS is a small **Go webserver** that uses [CertMagic](https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic) to automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates via ACME (Let’s Encrypt or a custom ACME CA).
It then exports the obtained certificates into **Java-compatible keystores and truststores** (`.jks`), making it easy to integrate with Java applications such as **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, **Spring Boot**, etc.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔑 **Automatic certificate management**
  Uses CertMagic with ACME (HTTP-01 challenge) to obtain and renew TLS certificates for your domain.

* 📦 **Java keystore export**
  Creates/updates a `keystore.jks` containing the private key and full certificate chain.
  Useful for Java servers that require a JKS keystore instead of PEM files.

* 🔒 **Java truststore export**
  Loads your custom CA root certificate(s) from a PEM bundle and writes them into a `truststore.jks`.
  Supports **multiple CA roots** (alias names are auto-generated).

* 🔄 **Auto-updates on renewal**
  When CertMagic renews a certificate, the keystore is automatically regenerated.
  Truststore is written at startup.

* ⚙️ **Custom ACME server support**
  Works with Let’s Encrypt or your own **private ACME CA**, using a custom directory URL and root certificate.

* 🌍 **Port 80 only**
  Runs an HTTP server on port `:80` for:

  * ACME HTTP-01 challenges
  * Optional application endpoints (simple demo handler is included).

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites

* Go 1.21+
* Your domain must resolve to the machine running this program.
* Port 80 must be reachable from the internet (required for HTTP-01 challenge).

### Build & Run

```bash
go build -o acme-jks-exporter
./acme-jks-exporter
```

Or run directly:

```bash
go run .
```

### Container releases

Every push to `main` builds the Dockerfile and publishes a `linux/amd64` image to
`ghcr.io/define42/acme2jks` using the
[container release workflow](.github/workflows/container-release.yml).

Versions use `YYYY.MM.DD.RUN_NUMBER.RUN_ATTEMPT`, with the date in UTC. For example,
`2026.10.12.42.1` is the first attempt of workflow run 42 on October 12, 2026.
The run number distinguishes multiple pushes on the same day, and the attempt
number gives reruns their own version. Each push runs independently so a newer
push does not cancel an earlier release.

Find the published version, image digest, and pull command in the workflow run's
summary or the repository's **Packages** section. Pull a specific release with:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/define42/acme2jks:2026.10.12.42.1
```

Replace the example version with a published tag. Publishing uses the built-in
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`; no additional registry credentials are
required. The image name is derived from the repository name and converted to
lowercase, so forks publish under their own owner and repository.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is done via **environment variables**:

| Variable           | Description                                                                                                | Default            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `TLS_DOMAIN`       | Domain to issue certificate for (required)                                                                 | –                  |
| `ACME_URL`         | ACME server directory URL (e.g. Let’s Encrypt staging/prod, or private CA)                                 | Let’s Encrypt prod |
| `ACME_CA_CERT`     | Path to PEM bundle of custom ACME CA root(s). If set, used both for CertMagic trust and truststore export. | –                  |
| `ACME_EMAIL`       | Contact email for ACME registration                                                                        | `admin@<domain>`   |
| `KEYSTORE_PATH`    | Path to generated keystore file                                                                            | `keystore.jks`     |
| `KEYSTORE_PASS`    | Password for the keystore                                                                                  | `changeit`         |
| `KEYSTORE_ALIAS`   | Alias name for the private key entry                                                                       | `server`           |
| `TRUSTSTORE_PATH`  | Path to generated truststore file                                                                          | `truststore.jks`   |

## 🖥 Example

Using a private ACME server with a custom CA root:

```bash
export TLS_DOMAIN="mydomain.local"
export ACME_URL="https://my-acme-server.example/acme/directory"
export ACME_CA_CERT="/etc/pki/ca-bundle.pem"
export ACME_EMAIL="me@mydomain.local"

export KEYSTORE_PATH="/etc/ssl/keystores/myapp.jks"
export KEYSTORE_PASS="supersecret"
export KEYSTORE_ALIAS="tomcat"

export TRUSTSTORE_PATH="/etc/ssl/keystores/mytruststore.jks"
export TRUSTSTORE_PASS="trustsecret"
export TRUSTSTORE_ALIAS="myca"

go run .
```

Results:

* `myapp.jks` → Contains private key + full certificate chain.
* `mytruststore.jks` → Contains all CA roots from `/etc/pki/ca-bundle.pem`.

---

## 🔧 How it Works

1. **CertMagic configuration**

   * Sets up an `ACMEIssuer` with the given ACME URL and email.
   * If `ACME_CA_CERT` is provided, the root cert(s) are loaded into a custom trust pool.

2. **Certificate management**

   * Calls `cfg.ManageSync()` for your domain.
   * CertMagic handles issuance and renewal in the background.

3. **Event handling**

   * `cfg.OnEvent` listens for `"cert_obtained"` and `"cert_renewed"`.
   * When triggered, it regenerates the `keystore.jks`.

4. **Keystore generation**

   * Converts the Go `crypto.PrivateKey` into PKCS#8 DER.
   * Stores the private key and certificate chain in a JKS keystore.

5. **Truststore generation**

   * Reads the PEM bundle from `ACME_CA_CERT`.
   * Adds each certificate as a trusted entry in `truststore.jks`.

6. **Web server**

   * Starts an HTTP server on port `:80`.
   * Serves ACME challenges automatically.
   * Example handler responds with a greeting on `/`.
